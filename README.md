# Rick and Morty Character Deck

This project uses data from the Rick and Morty API and renders the fetched character data into card components. The user can search for a certain character and the application will make a new fetch request including the currently typed search query. Should the user be on any page number other than 1 and then decide to update the search query then the application will render a new page 1 of the fetched characters from the updated query.
